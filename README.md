What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
-Determining what data structures would be applied under diffeent circumstances with differing data.
-Deturmining efficiency of various sorting algorithms on a certain data set.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
-I looked at the amount of data in the data structure, whether or not the data will be modified frequently, if the data will be 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
-One meathod I used to overcome roadblocks was looking back on the previous programs I have written. For many problems I encountered
 I had come across something similar before and was able to use those past instances to my advantage.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
-Previously when writing code I didn't think about runtime and space. Now I am consistantly thinking of whether my method of solving a problem is the most efficient.
-I now have a better understanding of recursion and will be able to solve problems that require recursion.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-I ensure my comments are clear and concise. Comments that are too long tend to overcomplicate the purpose of a section
 of code, and too short of comments usually don't have enough information to reveal that codes purpose.
-Using minimal code in the main function. Too much code in the function Main tends to severely reduce readability and maintainability of code.
